This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C programming codes developed during my learning and practice of the C programming language.

The programs included in this repository demonstrate my understanding of core C concepts such as variables and data types, control structures (conditional statements and loops), functions, arrays, pointers, structures, and basic data structures. Some programs also focus on problem-solving and logical implementation using C.

All codes have been written and tested for educational purposes and reflect a structured approach to learning C programming fundamentals and strengthening programming skills.
